# GuustoCoding

Hi Alan and Felipe

Here is the code for the backend I was working on for the coding challenge.
My idea was to create microservices to handle the bussines logic, created an authorization microservice and a server that works as a gateway.
Some of the microservices comunicate to others and some others don't.

You can notice that I didnt make a front or complete the docker container for all of the services.
I already passed the time limit that I had to complete this and still have lots of more thing to learn to use all this properly.

Even when this didnt go as I expected, it was a great chance to put what I'm learning in practice.

Thanks a lot
Regards
